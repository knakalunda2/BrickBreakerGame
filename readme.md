This document proposes a novel application of BrickBreaker, the classic arcade game but with a space theme. Players can navigate through a title screen menu to start and exit from the game. Players move their paddle left and right to deflect the ball upwards and crush the blocks. Each level increases the difficulty. Players can earn power ups that can temporarily make the paddle bigger, slow down the ball, or give you multiple balls to use.
